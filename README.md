WIP Roguelike

## nb: I've completely stopped working on this.
I won't be continuing development on this because a) the codebase is horrible and b) Java is just too unwieldy for me at this point.

However, the project is still executable, and at the very least the dungeon generation is kinda cool. Hit 'G' (if you can manage to get everything working) and it should generate a new dungeon. Somewhere towards the beginning of the dungeon gen source file you should be able to edit some of the settings.

Cheers :)
